# DevShell

DevShell is a lightweight, zero-database local script manager and execution environment. Built for developers and DevOps engineers, it provides a unified graphical interface to manage, edit, secure, and execute shell scripts across local directory structures.

## Core Features

- **Zero-DB Architecture:** Operates entirely on the local file system. Scripts are read directly from a structured `scripts/` directory. State and security parameters are maintained in local JSON files (`locks.json`, `favorites.json`).
- **Real-Time Execution Engine:** Utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream subprocess outputs (stdout/stderr) immediately to the frontend.
- **Multi-Tab Terminal:** Supports isolated, concurrent terminal execution environments. 
- **Persistent Execution History:** Stores timestamped command and script runs, failed executions, and per-run log files for later search and export.
- **Process Resource Monitoring:** Features a dedicated background thread for tracking isolated CPU and memory usage statistics attributed strictly to the active script process.
- **In-Memory Search Highlights:** Non-destructive DOM traversal algorithms allow live keyword grepping within active terminal streams.
- **Local Password Locking:** Scripts can be securely locked behind a PBKDF2/SHA-256 local hash to prevent unauthorized reading or execution.
- **GitHub Integration:** Pull scripts directly from public raw GitHub URLs via the interface.

## System Architecture

The project follows a hybrid architecture easily packaged into standalone desktop executables.

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
- **Backend API:** Python (`Flask`). Handles file system I/O, cryptographic locking, OS subprocess management, and resource monitoring (`psutil`).
- **Desktop Wrapper:** Electron. The application supports running as a native desktop application through Electron and `electron-builder`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+ and npm (For the Electron wrapper)
- A Unix-like bash terminal equivalent available in system PATH (Git Bash, WSL, or native Linux/macOS bash).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd DevShell
```

### 2. Backend Setup

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment for the Python backend dependencies.

```bash
pip install flask psutil
```

### 3. Frontend / Desktop Setup

Install Node dependencies required for the Electron frontend integration.

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Desktop Mode (Electron)
To launch the application as a standalone desktop interface (Highly Recommended):

```bash
npm start
```

### Web Mode (Backend Only)
Alternatively, start the Python Flask server to host the web interface locally on your browser.

```bash
python app.py
```
*The server will run on port 5000. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.*

### Building Distributables (Linux)
To compile the Electron application into a standalone `.AppImage` distribution:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Project Scope & Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application, API routing, subprocess handling, and SSE response generation.
- `logs/`: Persistent execution history, failed-command records, and per-run `.log` files.
- `scripts/`: Root directory for user scripts. Scripts are organized dynamically based on subfolders (categories).
- `ui/`: Contains all frontend assets (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`).
- `main.js`: Electron initialization and window management.

## Contributing Guidelines

Contributions from the open-source community are welcome. Please adhere to the following technical guidelines when submitting pull requests:

1. **Keep Dependencies Minimal:** The core philosophy of DevShell is lightweight execution. Avoid introducing complex external npm packages, compilers, or heavy Python frameworks.
2. **Vanilla Frontend System:** Core UI features should be implemented in Vanilla JS/CSS without reliance on build steps (e.g., React, Vue, Tailwind).
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure OS subprocess invocations account for both Windows architectures (via Git Bash/WSL/cmd) and native POSIX Linux systems. Avoid hardcoding OS-specific file paths.
4. **Code Formatting:** Adhere strictly to PEP-8 for Python components and standard modern JS styling.

### Submission Process

1. Fork the project.
2. Create your designated feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewFeature`).
3. Commit your changes logically (`git commit -m 'Add NewFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/NewFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request detailing the technical changes and architectural impact.
